    "# Getting Started With `pymcmcstat`\n",
    "\n",
    "Author(s): Paul Miles | Date: June 18, 2018\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The `pymcmcstat` package is a Python program for running Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations.\n",
    "Included in this package is the abilitity to use different Metropolis based sampling techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Metropolis-Hastings (MH): Primary sampling method.\n",
    "* Adaptive-Metropolis (AM): Adapts covariance matrix at specified intervals.\n",
    "* Delayed-Rejection (DR): Delays rejection by sampling from a narrower distribution.  Capable of *n*-stage delayed rejection.\n",
    "* Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis (DRAM): DR + AM\n",
    "\n",
    "The [pymcmcstat homepage](https://prmiles.wordpress.ncsu.edu/codes/python-packages/pymcmcstat/) contains tutorials for users as well as installation instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python implementation of Matlab toolbox \"mcmcstat\".  This code is designed to replicate the functionality of the Matlab routines developed and posted here: http://helios.fmi.fi/~lainema/mcmc/\n",
    "\n",
    "The user interface is designed to be as similar to the Matlab version as possible, but this implementation has taken advantage of certain data structure concepts more amenable to python.  Documentation for the package can be found here:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "This code can be found on the [Github project page](https://github.com/prmiles/pymcmcstat).  It is open sources and provided under the MIT license.\n",
    "To install directly from Github,\n",
    "    \n",
    "```python\n",
    "pip install git+https://github.com/prmiles/pymcmcstat.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can also clone the repository and run `python setup.py install`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Package is currently in the process of being added to the PyPI distribution site.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  General Examples\n",
    "There are many built-in features to `pymcmcstat` that allow it to be tailored to suit your particular problem.  Below we have outlined features through a set of examples.\n",
