    "# Getting Started With `mcmcplot`\n",
    "Author(s): Paul Miles | August 7, 2018\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "The [mcmcplot](https://prmiles.wordpress.ncsu.edu/codes/python-packages/mcmcplot/) package is designed to assist in the analysis of sampling chains gathered during a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation.  This package was designed with the MCMC code [pymcmcstat](http://pymcmcstat.readthedocs.io/) in mind; however, the plotting routines are amenable to other data sets.  The plotting routines use [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).  User's are recommended to investigate other plotting routines available in [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) as it is specifically designed for this sort of analysis.  The routines available in [mcmcplot](https://prmiles.wordpress.ncsu.edu/codes/python-packages/mcmcplot/) serve as a useful wrapper function for several [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) plots, but it is not an exhaustive demonstration.\n",

    "### Installation\n",
    "The code can be found on the [Github project page](https://github.com/prmiles/mcmcplot).  The package is available on the PyPI distribution site and the latest version can be installed via\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pip install mcmcplot\n",
    "```\n",
    "The master branch typically matches the latest version on the PyPI distribution site.  To install the master branch directly from Github,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pip install git+https://github.com/prmiles/mcmcplot.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can also clone the repository and run `python setup.py install`."

    "### Basic Examples\n",
    "The following examples demonstrate how to plot a set of randomly generated chains.  For physically motivated examples, see the [pymcmcstat tutorials](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/prmiles/notebooks/blob/master/pymcmcstat/index.ipynb).\n",
